      <div>
        <h1>Skills & Expertise</h1>
        <p>My proficiency spans a wide array of technologies, including languages like C++, Java, Python, and more. With over five years of experience in Software Engineering, I specialize in both Frontend and Backend Development. I am well-versed in the intricacies of HTML/CSS, React, and JavaScript, and I have a solid foundation in Object-Oriented Programming. My technical toolkit also includes Bootstrap, APIs, Software Testing, and Agile methodologies.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h1>Education & Certification</h1>
        <p>I recently completed a comprehensive Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification along with a Responsive Web Design Certification from FreeCodeCamp.com, and I am currently in the process of completing my Front End Development Libraries Certification. I am also ranked on LinkedIn in the top 30% of HTML programmers and the top 15% CSS programmers based on my skill assessment exams. My academic journey at CSUMB has equipped me with the knowledge and skills necessary to excel in the dynamic field of Computer Science and these skills are backed up through my certifications, as I continue to develop my skills and earn more certifications.</p>

      <div>
        <h1>Professional Experience</h1>
        <p>In my role as a Full Stack Development Intern at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI), I lead the charge in designing and implementing a full-stack intranet site. Through agile project management, I directed a team of developers to deliver high-quality solutions in Node.js, HTML/CSS, and JSX. With the completion of this position, I was able to reduce matinance costs by 99%.</p>
        <p>Simultaneously, I have been serving as a Supervisor at CSUMB Dining Commons, where my responsibilities extend beyond the technical realm. Here, I developed and maintained training programs and work schedules for the team, ensuring a cohesive and efficient work environment. My role involved evaluating worker performance, recognizing high achievers, and enforcing adherence to quality and productivity standards. I produced and analyzed production and sales reports, playing a pivotal role in upholding quality and safety expectations. Acting as a trustworthy liaison, I fostered an environment where employees felt comfortable sharing information and concerns. Moreover, I took on a mentoring role, guiding team members in goal-setting and fostering their professional advancement within the team.</p>
        <p>My experience as the Treasurer on the OSU Board of Directors added a strategic and financial dimension to my skill set. Nominated as acting Treasurer, I represented CSUMB students and actively addressed concerns within the board. In this capacity, I assisted in budget calculations and presented proposals for the board's approval, demonstrating my financial acumen and ability to make data-driven decisions. Regularly attending meetings, I contributed to the enhancement of CSUMB by serving on the budget, audit, and art committees, showcasing my commitment to collaborative decision-making and strategic planning.</p>
        <p>Through these diverse experiences, I've honed my ability to manage teams, make strategic decisions, and contribute to the overall success of multifaceted projects.</p>

        <h3>MBARI Modernization Project</h3>
        <p class="description">
          With the completion of my internship at the Monterey Bay Marine Research Institute, MBARI, I achieved a viable cost reduction of 79-99% saving over $24,000 annually. 
          As a greenfield project, I outlined the design and implementation of the full-stack intranet site for my team.
          I orchestrated project timelines using an agile approach, and directed my team of developers towards the final product.
          This project is coded in Node.js, HTML/CSS, and JSX, for the frontend and Java springboot, and MySQL for the backend.

        <h3>Code Camp Certification Projects</h3>
        <p class="description">
          To test myself and prove my knowladge, I have been working on coding certifications, each of which takes about 300 hours of work.
          I earned my Responsive Web Design Certification early October 2023.
          Next I earned my Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification at the end of that same month.
          Currently, I am working on my Front End Development Libraries Certification.
          I am planning on working through all the avaliable certifications, and learning needed skills along the way in order to improve myself.

        <h3>My Personal Portfolio Site</h3>
        <p class="description">
          This website I made from scratch using a combination of HTML and CSS.
          I am currently hosting it on GitHub Pages, and the repository is also available for viewing on GitHub.
          I used an agile approach for this project and have completed extensive end to end and black-box user testing.
          This project was started December 2023, and I plan on continuing to update this site throughout my professional career.
          I have opted to rely on only HTML and CSS rather than including JS so that I may take advantage of free GitHub Pages hosting.
